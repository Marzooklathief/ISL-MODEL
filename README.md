Indian Sign Language Prediction Model
Overview
This project aims to develop a robust model for predicting Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures using deep learning techniques. The goal is to recognize and classify ISL hand gestures into their corresponding alphabets or digits, facilitating communication between sign language users and others.

Motivation
Indian Sign Language is a vital means of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in India. However, there is a significant gap in technology that can interpret and translate ISL into text or speech. This project seeks to bridge this gap by developing a reliable ISL recognition system.

Features
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Uses video input from a webcam to detect and classify ISL gestures in real-time.

Deep Learning Model: Employs a deep neural network to improve accuracy and robustness.

Support for Multiple Gestures: Recognizes a wide range of ISL gestures, including alphabets and digits.

Requirements
Python 3.8 or Higher

TensorFlow or PyTorch

OpenCV

NumPy

Installation

Install Dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download Dataset:
Use the Indian Sign Language Dataset for training and testing.

Usage
Run the Model:

bash

python main.py

Start the Webcam:

The program will start capturing video frames from your webcam and display the recognized gestures in real-time.

Model Architecture
The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify ISL gestures. The CNN is trained on a dataset of images representing various ISL hand gestures.

Dataset
The dataset consists of images of ISL gestures captured in different orientations and lighting conditions. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80:20.
